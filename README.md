# Temperature-Application
Solve the following with a MATLAB script. Include an output statement answering the question in the first bullet point.

The equation for the temperature T of a certain object immersed in a liquid bath of constant temperature, Tb, is

10(dT/dt) + T = Tb

The initial temperature of the object is 70 ̊F and the bath temperature is 170 ̊F.

• Report the temperature after 10, 20, and 40 seconds

• How long does it take for the object to reach 160 ̊F? (Give answer to one decimal place.)

• Plot the function for T(t) for the first 40 seconds. Set the range of the vertical axis from 0 to 180 ̊C.

Include a grid, title, and axis labels.
